# fully_fledged_login_system

Hey My self Ekansh Tiwari . I Had created a Login System With The Use OF PHP , MYSQl, BOOTSTrap , HTML.

In this project there is a LOGIN page Where User Can Login To the Web & IF the Connection is unsuccessful Then User Cannot Login.
There IS the Registration Page For the user to register along with some features like there should no blank column etc.
If you Have To see the Output You Should Have A Xamp For Local Host Hosting.
